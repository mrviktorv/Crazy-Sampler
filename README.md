# Crazy Sampler
1) Run the application (Press any button if nothing happens).
2) Enter the name of the sample you want to play with (name only, no extension type).
   The sample must be in the application folder.*
3) Make sure the application window is active (click on it).
4) Use the A-K buttons on the keyboard to control the sampler.

* There are some readymade samples to play with, but You can add your own samples: they must be in .wav format (8, 16 or 32 bit),
and they must be mono.

Have fun!
